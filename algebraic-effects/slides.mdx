# Algebraic Effects

In this presentation we'll be looking into modeling effects in pure functional programming.

Here's the outline:

1. What exactly is meant by _effects_?
2. The well-known: a glance of Functors, Applicative Functors and Monads
3. How are _algebraic effects_ different, and where/how can they improve our code?

# What are _effects_?

# Consuming under constraints

Often when we're working with the real world, our values aren't quite as pretty:

- The value may not exist <Badge>Maybe</Badge> <Badge>Option</Badge>
- The value may not exist yet <Badge>Promise</Badge>
- The value may not exist, but if it doesn't we're given a why <Badge>Either</Badge> <Badge>Result</Badge>
- There may be multiple values <Badge>List</Badge>
- The value may vary over time <Badge>Behavior</Badge> <Badge>Signal</Badge>
- The value is produced outside our code / total control <Badge>IO</Badge>

In _some_ (gross) languages we're left totally on our own:
* We check for null every time we have to use it, and
* we set i=0 and i++ while i < length whenever we have to walk along the list

We shouldn't have to tell the computer how to traverse a list.
How do we simplify our code?

# In depth: Promises

Well-known approaches to this problem are the **Functor**, **Applicative Functor** and **Monad**.
We'll focus on Promises because they're rather pleasant to diagram.

<p>
  <Highlight>Here is a function.</Highlight>{' '}
  As we're coming from a functional perspective,
  let's do some groundwork and be exact with how we are defining functions.
  Functions merely receive some information and give us back new information,{' '}
  ideally <strong>immutably</strong> and with <strong>referentially transparency</strong>.
</p>

<Pass>{svgs.function}</Pass>

<p>
  <Highlight>And here is a Promise.</Highlight>{' '}
  Promises represent values which are pending (do not exist yet).
</p>

<Pass>{svgs.promise}</Pass>

---

# Functors

The simplest operation is to forward (preserve) the effects.
Maybe we're just not at the right layer to properly handle them.

Structures which permit this kind of operation are known as _Functors_.
Promises are Functors.

<p>
  The fundamental operation is map, or <code>{'<$>'}</code>, which involves three values:
  {anon(function FunctorsStep() {
    const showCppStyle = !useSteps(1);
    return (
      <ul>
        <li><code>{showCppStyle ? 'f<a>' : 'f a'}</code>, values of type <code>a</code> constrained by the Functor <code>f</code></li>
        <li><code>(a -> b)</code>, a function to take the input <code>a</code>s to the output <code>b</code>s</li>
        <li>The output, <code>{showCppStyle ? 'f<b>' : 'f b'}</code>: values of type <code>b</code> constrained by the same Functor <code>f</code></li>
      </ul>
    );
  })}
</p>

<Pass>{svgs.promiseFunctor}</Pass>

---

# Functor Examples

<Pass>{svgs.promiseFunctorExample}</Pass>

<Pass>{svgs.listFunctorExample}</Pass>

---

# From Functors to Monads

Suppose we can take our `bank_info` and make an HTTP request to the bank's API for the user's `balance`.
Again, we can simply use the Functor map.

<Pass>{svgs.mapToPromiseOfPromise}</Pass>

<p>
  {anon(function FunctorsToMonadStep() {
    const showCppStyle = !useSteps(1);
    return (
      <>
        However, what we get back is not a <code>
          {showCppStyle ? 'Promise<bank_info>' : 'Promise bank_info'}
        </code> but rather a <code>
          {showCppStyle ? 'Promise<Promise<bank_info>>' : 'Promise (Promise bank_info) '}
        </code>.
        We have the information we want.
        There's just more detail than we care for.
      </>
    );
  })}
</p>

---

# Monads

<p>
  We don't want a Promise to a Promise to a <code>balance</code>.
  We simply want a Promise to a <code>balance</code>.
  Fortunately for Promises, this operation is pretty simple:
  just <Highlight>wait for the first, then wait for the second.</Highlight>
</p>

<Pass>{svgs.joinPromise}</Pass>

`join` is a function which does just that.
However, it isn't just for Promises.
All **Monads** must define it.
You may be surprised by how many Functors are also Monads.
This is `join`'s type:

<Pass>
  {anon(function MonadsIntro() {
    const showContext = !!useSteps(1);
    const context = (
      <Reveal reveal={showContext}>
        {'Monad f => '}
      </Reveal>
    );
    return (
      <blockquote>
        <code>{context}f (f a) -> f a</code>, or rephrased, <code>{context}(f . f) a -> f a</code>
      </blockquote>
    );
  })}
</Pass>

For another point of reference,
`join`'ing a list is simply concatenating all inner lists: `join [[], [3], [], [9]] = [3, 9]`

For those familiar with monoids,
that rephrased type might make it clearer how monads relate to monoids.

---

# The `=<<` function

In producing our `Promise balance` we used:

> `join (fetchBalance <$> pendingBankInfo)`

`join`'ing after `<$>`'ing is so common it is usually provided out of the box, such as

- `=<<` in Haskell (for all monads)
- `.flatMap` in JavaScript Arrays <sm>_(argument order flipped)_</sm>
- `.and_then` in Rust's Option and Result <sm>_(argument order flipped)_</sm>

Precisely, `=<<` has a type of:

> `(a -> f b) -> f a -> f b`

Which is shockingly similar to `<$>`'s own type.
We'll look into this more as we introduce **Applicative Functors**.

---

# Applicative Functors

Applicative functors are the step between functors and monads.
Some functors can't be monads, but can be applicative functors.

Suppose you wanted to combine multiple small values into one.
Monads are overkill!
Some structures which <Highlight>aren't monads</Highlight> _are_ capable of this kind of combining.

<Pass>
  {anon(function ApplicativeFunctorsIntroSteps() {
    const step = useSteps(1);
    return [svgs.promiseIntroApplicative1, svgs.promiseIntroApplicative2][step];
  })}
</Pass>

---

# Applicative Functors

Looking at the types,
there is something between the two.
Something which allows a context on the function,
but which doesn't allow the context to depend on `a`.

<Pass>
  {anon(function ApplicativeFunctorsStep() {
    const step = useSteps(2);
    return (
      <>
        <ul>
          <li><pre><code>
            {'(<$>) :: (a -> b) ->   f a -> f b'}
          </code></pre></li>
          <li><pre>
            {step === 0 ? (
              <span style={{ fontFamily: 'Ubuntu Mono' }}>
                ???
              </span>
            ) : (
              <code>
                {'(<*>) :: f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b'}
              </code>
            )}
          </pre></li>
          <li><code>
            {'(=<<) :: (a -> f b) -> f a -> f b'}
          </code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Command line argument parsers are an example of applicative functors
          {' '}which <Highlight>aren't monads</Highlight>{step === 2 ? ':' : '.'}
        </p>
        {step === 2 && (
          <>
          <SyntaxHighlight language="haskell" style={prismTheme}>
            {[
            `makeOptions :: String -> String -> Bool -> Options`,
            `parseOptions :: ArgParse Options`,
            `parseOptions = makeOptions`,
            `  <$> argument acceptString  -- input file`,
            `  <*> strOption 'o'  -- output file`,
            `  <*> switch 'q' False  -- quiet mode`,
            ].join('\n')}
          </SyntaxHighlight>
          <p>
            An interesting observation is that <code>{'<*>'}</code> is simply a distributive property over functions.
          </p>
          </>
        )}
      </>
    );
  })}
</Pass>

# Sequencing

Sequencing is one of the most powerful and most awesomest formalizations
which result from the applicative functor.

Consider you have a list of Promises.
How do you use this?
Usually, you'll just wait for them all to come back first.
In JavaScript, there's a handy function which does just that, <Highlight>Promise.all</Highlight>:

<Pass>{svgs.sequencePromiseList}</Pass>

Viewed from the types, this is very interesting.
We turn <Highlight>a list of promises</Highlight> into a <Highlight>promise of a list</Highlight>.

---

# Sequencing

Sequencing is a fantastic example of **unopinionated code**.
Given two effects, such as multiplicity and asynchronicity,
unopinionated code can't destroy either effect.
That would be opinionated!
Yet we can still do something useful â€” by changing the order.

Consider an `if` statement which checks a bunch of nullable values.
This is a sequencing!

> What we're really doing is turning a <Highlight>list of maybes</Highlight> into a <Highlight>maybe of a list</Highlight>.

Consider pulling the most recent value of time-varying, asynchronous action.
This is a sequencing!

> What we're really doing is turning a <Highlight>signal of a promise</Highlight> into a <Highlight>promise of a signal</Highlight>.

And these functions aren't type busy-work.
They do very material things.

## Note

However, note that applicative functors don't sequence (in general) with other applicative functors.
They are guaranteed to sequence with any _Traversable_.
Traversables are more powerful _Foldables_ (which fulfill the same role as iterators).
Lists are an example of a Traversable.

So, there is no function to sequence a promise of a maybe into a maybe of a promise.

---

# Sequencing example

Let's keep track of the current contents of a file.

<SyntaxHighlight language="haskell" style={prismTheme}>
  {[
    `-- Given these functions...`,
    `readFile   :: FilePath -> Promise String`,
    `notifyFile :: FilePath -> Promise (Signal ())`,
    `-- we want to define watchFile:`,
    `watchFile  :: FilePath -> Promise (Signal String))`,
  ].join('\n')}
</SyntaxHighlight>

Let's see our three tools (functor mapping, sequencing, and monad joining) in action!

<Pass>
  {anon(function SequencingExample() {
    const step = useSteps(3);
    const lastStepRef = useRef(step);
    const lastStep = lastStepRef.current;
    useEffect(() => { lastStepRef.current = step });
    const div1 = useRef();
    const div2 = useRef();
    const isTrans = step >= 2;
    const isJoin = step === 3;
    return (
      <pre className="mono" style={{
        backgroundColor: '#ffffff40',
        display: 'flex',
        padding: '2px 0.25em',
      }}>
        <Trans>{isJoin ? '' : 'Promise ('}</Trans>
        <Switcher me={div1} switchWith={isTrans && div2}>
          Signal
        </Switcher>
        <div> (</div>
        <Trans
          width={[0, 'Promise String'.length, 'Signal String'.length][step]}
          style={(isTrans || (step === 1 && lastStep === 2)) ? { overflow: 'visible' } : undefined}
        >
          {step ? (
            <>
              <Switcher me={div2} switchWith={isTrans && div1}>Promise</Switcher>
              <div> String</div>
            </>
          ) : ''}
        </Trans>
        <div>
          )
        </div>
        <Trans>
          {isJoin ? '' : ')'}
        </Trans>
      </pre>
    );
  })}
</Pass>

# Sequencing example

Let's step it up a bit.
Now we want to track the current contents of a directory.
We have a bonus function:

<SyntaxHighlight language="haskell" style={prismTheme}>
  {[
    `-- Given these functions...`,
    `readFile   :: FilePath -> Promise String`,
    `notifyFile :: FilePath -> Promise (Signal ())`,
    `scanDir    :: FilePath -> Promise (Signal (List FilePath))`,
    `-- we want to define watchDir:`,
    `watchDir   :: FilePath -> Promise (Signal (List (String, FilePath)))`,
  ].join('\n')}

<Pass>
  {anon(function SequencingExampleDirectory() {
    const div1 = useRef();
    const div2 = useRef();

# Algebraic Effects

# Configuration problem

If your entire program is pure functions,
then all dynamic inputs must be parameters.
However, passing through many layers <Highlight>can get quite painful!</Highlight>
In Haskell this is known as the configuration problem.

Ideally a solution would excel in these ways:

- (type) Visibility: Codepaths can make it obvious the envars they require
- (type) Safety: Verify that codepaths have the envars they require
- It should not be annoying: busy to write or busy to read

Some other names from other spaces, as well as some solutions:

- Dependency injection
- POSIX environment variables
- React context
- Reader monad

This is a problem people care about.

---

# Error handling

Another problem people care about is error handling.

Monadic error handling is wonderfully _expressive_,
but for some/rare errors having to lift our data (into a monad) is excessively verbose.

Almost what we want is `try`â€“`catch`.
Maybe Java found a **kernel of truth** here?

We'd like to raise an error, and then defer to a handler somewhere higher in the codepath.
We also don't want to end up with either Java's unchecked exceptions, or Java's checked exceptions.

---

# Algebraic Effects

In both these problems we want to defer to a handler higher in the codepath
without "infecting" the layers between.

# Koka

Generalized algebraic effects are not mainstream (yet?).
Notably OCaml has them.
**Koka**, **Frank** and **Eff** are some research languages made to study algebraic effects.

Let's peek at some of the [documentation](https://koka-lang.github.io/koka/doc/book.html#why).

---

# Concerns

We see that Koka is quite different than the notions of pure functional.

- Koka functions are privileged: regular values cannot have effects
- Koka has an evaluation order

That last poses the biggest problem if we want algebraic effects in pure functional programming.

## More concerns

They are <Highlight>troubling in a few other ways</Highlight> too (in my estimation):

- Most effects can simply be done in monads. Monads require _no_ language support, past basics like Higher Order Types.
- Explicit typings: are effects specified or inferred? Preferably both, but that's hard to make nice syntactically.
- They require a _vision_. Implementations offer various _language features_.

---

# Complements, or competitors?

When I started preparing for this presentation I thought they were complements.
Now my understanding is that algebraic effects are a whole different paradigm.

<Pass>

_Verdict:_ Competitors
