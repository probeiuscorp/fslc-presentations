# Algebraic Effects

In this presentation we'll be looking into modeling effects in pure functional programming.

Here's the outline:

1. What exactly is meant by _effects_?
2. The well-known: a glance of Functors, Applicative Functors and Monads
3. How are _algebraic effects_ different, and where/how can they improve our code?

# Part 1: What are _effects_?

# Consuming under constraints

But sometimes when we're working with the real world, our values aren't quite as pretty:

- The value may not exist (Maybe/Option)
- The value may not exist yet (Promise)
- The value may not exist, but if it doesn't we're given a why (Either/Result)
- There may be multiple values (List)
- The value may vary over time (Behavior/Signal)
- The value is produced outside our code / total control (IO)

In _some_ (gross) languages we're left totally on our own:
* We check for null every time we have to use it, and
* we set i=0 and i++ while i < length whenever we have to walk along the list

We shouldn't have to tell the computer how to traverse a list.
How do we simplify our code?

# In depth: Promises

Well-known approaches to this problem are the **Functor**, **Applicative Functor** and **Monad**.
We'll focus on Promises because they're rather pleasant to diagram.

<p>
  <Highlight>Here is a function.</Highlight>{' '}
  As we're coming from a functional perspective,
  let's do some groundwork and be exact with how we are defining functions.
  Functions receive some information and give us back new information.
  Everything is <strong>immutable</strong> and <strong>referentially transparent</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  <Highlight>And here is a Promise.</Highlight>{' '}
  Promises represent values which are pending (do not exist yet).
</p>

# Functors

The simplest operation is to forward (preserve) the effects.
Maybe we're just not at the right layer to properly handle them.

Structures which permit this kind of operation are known as _Functors_.
Promises are Functors.

<p>
  The fundamental operation is map, or <code>{'<$>'}</code>, which involves three values:
  {anon(function FunctorsStep() {
    const showCppStyle = !useSteps(1);
    return (
      <ul>
        <li><code>{showCppStyle ? 'f<a>' : 'f a'}</code>, values of type <code>a</code> constrained by the Functor <code>f</code></li>
        <li><code>(a -> b)</code>, a function to take the input <code>a</code>s to the output <code>b</code>s</li>
        <li>The output, <code>{showCppStyle ? 'f<b>' : 'f b'}</code>: values of type <code>b</code> constrained by the same Functor <code>f</code></li>
      </ul>
    );
  })}
</p>

# From Functors to Monads

Suppose we can take our `bank_info` and make an HTTP request to the bank's API for the user's `balance`.
Again, we can simply use the Functor map.

![](map-to-promise-of-promise.svg)

<p>
  {anon(function FunctorsToMonadStep() {
    const showCppStyle = !useSteps(1);
    return (
      <>
        However, what we get back is not a <code>
          {showCppStyle ? 'Promise<bank_info>' : 'Promise bank_info'}
        </code> but rather a <code>
          {showCppStyle ? 'Promise<Promise<bank_info>>' : 'Promise (Promise bank_info) '}
        </code>.
        We have the information we want.
        There's just more detail than we care for.
      </>
    );
  })}
</p>

# Monads

<p>
  We don't want a Promise to a Promise to a <code>balance</code>.
  We simply want a Promise to a <code>balance</code>.
  Fortunately for Promises, this operation is pretty simple:
  just <Highlight>wait for first, then wait for the second.</Highlight>
</p>

![](join-promise.svg)

`join` is a function which does just that.
However, it isn't just for Promises.
It is defined for all **Monads**.
You may be surprised by how many Functors are also Monads.
This is `join`'s type:

> `f (f a) -> f a`, or rephrased, `(f . f) a -> f a`

For another point of reference,
`join`'ing a list is simply concatenating all inner lists: `join [[], [3], [], [9]] = [3, 9]`

For those familiar with monoids,
that rephrased type might make it clearer how monads relate to monoids.
