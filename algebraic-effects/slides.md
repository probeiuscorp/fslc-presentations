# Algebraic Effects

In this presentation we'll be looking into modeling effects in pure functional programming.

Here's the outline:

1. What exactly is meant by _effects_?
2. The well-known: a glance of Functors, Applicative Functors and Monads
3. How are _algebraic effects_ different, and where/how can they improve our code?
