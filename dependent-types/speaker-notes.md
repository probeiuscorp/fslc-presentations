# Speaker notes

**Overall goal**: types are the same computationally as values

- I mention the Lambda Cube to show there's a lot of cool theory here you can look more into
- Questions are very welcome
- We may come back to this list of type systems ordered by power
- List length is just an application of pattern matching.
  _pattern matching_ is the syntax of `case ... of`
- I'm not thinking on classes. Classes make a mess of computation
- That generic types are functions is _the_ big point of the presentation
- Explain capturing scope
